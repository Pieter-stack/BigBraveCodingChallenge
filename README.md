## ðŸ”§ Quick Setup

1.  **To launch the app**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd BigBraveCodingChallenge/
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start creating your character!**

    The site is now running at http://localhost:3000!

3.  **Dependencies & Libraries**
    
    - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)
    - [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/)

4.  **Justifications**

Firebase was used to host the site. For the user to view the project without having to download the project and run the code.

I used React Color for the colour swatch interface to give the user a better experience for choosing a colour rather than using the normal colour pallette from the html inputs.

I have added some nice animations throughout the project with the help of Anime.js as the library for animations.I also did the text animation with just plain Css and Html to showcase animations without a JS library. I also customized all of the input fields to fit the overall theme of the project.

I did validation for the form inputs by disabling the next buttons if the inputs are empty and also did age and date validation per brief requirements.

I did spend around 9 hours to complete the project including research and designing of the frontend. I also didn't code in react for over a year so I had to refamilliarize myself with React. I went over the time estimate due to all the research I wanted to do extra, to make the project look sleeker and better.

The project meets all the brief requirements, I still feel there could be some improvements done on the project to improve the performance and some minor tweaks.

The project showcases a little bit of my development skills that I have learned so far and what I am capable of. I look forward to improving my skills and gaining more knowledge in the future.
